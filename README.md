# Credit Risk Analysis with Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to predict the risk of client default using advanced machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. The dataset includes anonymized client information, covering essential features for predictive modeling.

## Objective
The primary goal is to develop models capable of accurately predicting client default potential, thereby aiding in effective credit risk assessment.

## Data Description
The dataset encompasses various anonymized client features necessary for predictive modeling in credit risk analysis.

## Instructions

### Libraries Installation and Data Import
Before starting, ensure the following libraries are installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

These are essential for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis. The dataset can be loaded using pandas for robust data handling.

### Data Preprocessing
The preprocessing steps include:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical features
